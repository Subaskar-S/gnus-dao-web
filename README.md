## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
yarn dev                    # Start development server (port 3000)

# Building
yarn build                 # Standard Next.js build
yarn build:static          # Static export build
yarn build:hybrid          # Hybrid build for Cloudflare Pages
yarn build:production      # Production build with optimizations

# Testing
yarn test                  # Run unit tests
yarn test:coverage         # Run tests with coverage
yarn test:e2e             # Run Playwright end-to-end tests
yarn validate             # Run type-check + lint + tests

# Code Quality
yarn lint                  # Run ESLint
yarn lint:fix             # Fix linting issues automatically
yarn type-check           # TypeScript type checking
yarn format               # Format code with Prettier

# Deployment
yarn deploy:cloudflare     # Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
```

### Testing Strategy

The project includes comprehensive testing:

- **✅ Unit Tests**: Jest with React Testing Library for component testing
- **✅ E2E Tests**: Playwright for end-to-end user flow testing
- **✅ Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- **✅ Linting**: ESLint with custom rules for Web3 development
- **✅ Integration Tests**: Contract interaction testing

### Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**: `yarn dev` starts the development server
2. **Code Quality**: `yarn validate` runs all quality checks
3. **Testing**: `yarn test:coverage` ensures >80% test coverage
4. **Building**: `yarn build:hybrid` creates production-ready build
5. **Deployment**: Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions

## 🌐 Deployment

### Cloudflare Pages (Production)

The project is optimized for Cloudflare Pages deployment with hybrid functionality:

```bash
# Build for Cloudflare Pages
yarn build:hybrid

# Deploy using Wrangler CLI
wrangler pages deploy out --project-name=gnus-dao-web
```

**Live Deployment**: https://gnus-dao-web.pages.dev

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

Automated deployment pipeline includes:

- **✅ Code Quality Checks**: TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier
- **✅ Automated Testing**: Unit and integration tests
- **✅ Build Verification**: Ensures successful production builds
- **✅ Automatic Deployment**: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages on main branch
- **✅ Preview Deployments**: Deploy preview for pull requests


## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contract Integration

The platform integrates with Diamond pattern smart contracts (EIP-2535):

- **✅ Upgradeable Architecture**: Modular contract system with facets
- **✅ Gas Optimization**: Efficient function delegation and storage
- **✅ Feature Modularity**: Separate facets for proposals, voting, treasury
- **✅ Contract Address**: `0x57AE78C65F7Dd6d158DE9F4cA9CCeaA98C988199` (Sepolia)

### Key Contract Functions

```typescript
// Proposal Management
propose(title: string, ipfsHash: string) → uint256
getProposalBasic(proposalId: uint256) → (id, proposer, title, ipfsHash)
getProposalStatus(proposalId: uint256) → (startTime, endTime, totalVotes, executed, cancelled)

// Voting System
vote(proposalId: uint256, votes: uint256) → void
hasVoted(proposalId: uint256, voter: address) → bool
getVote(proposalId: uint256, voter: address) → uint256

// Configuration
getVotingConfig() → (proposalThreshold, votingDelay, votingPeriod, quorumThreshold)
```
