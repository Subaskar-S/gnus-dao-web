## üìä **DEPLOYMENT METRICS**

### **Build Output:**
```bash
Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
‚îå ‚óã /                                    15 kB           472 kB
‚îú ‚óã /proposals                           8.48 kB         457 kB
‚îú ‚óã /treasury                            3.17 kB         451 kB
‚îî ‚óã /analytics                           3.05 kB         451 kB

üìä Build size: 4.35M
‚úÖ Build validation completed
```

### **Performance Optimizations:**
- **First Load JS**: Optimized to ~450-470kB per route
- **Static Generation**: All pages pre-rendered as static content
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting for optimal loading
- **Compression**: Brotli compression enabled for faster delivery

## üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Content Security Policy:**
```bash
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

### **Environment Variables Security:**
- All secrets stored in GitHub Secrets
- Environment variables configured in Cloudflare Pages
- No sensitive data committed to repository
- Proper separation of development and production configs
